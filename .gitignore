If changes still appear in your Git client, it might be because the files you want to ignore were already tracked by Git before you added them to `.gitignore`. Git does not automatically stop tracking files that are already being tracked, even if they match a pattern in `.gitignore`.

To fix this, you need to untrack the files manually. Here's how:

1. Remove the files from the Git index (but not from your working directory) using the following command:
    ```bash
    git rm --cached -r .
    ```

2. Re-add all files to the index:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3. Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Update .gitignore and remove tracked files"
    ```

After this, the files matching the patterns in `.gitignore` should no longer appear in your Git client.
